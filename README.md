# mobile-project

Another project, this time the plan was to use Javascript and the React-Native framework to create an appstore. The idea was that the installation packages for individual apps would be stored in the Google Cloud Service and then downloaded on to the machine.

We tried to import the installation packages dynamically, but it failed and so opted to do it the boring way. Still, the program fetches information from the cloud using Restfull web services as a middle-man in communication.
